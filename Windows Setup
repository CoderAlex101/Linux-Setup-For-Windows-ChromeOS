🛠️ How to Set Up WSL on Windows (Step-by-Step)
✅ Requirements
Windows 10 (Version 2004 or higher) or Windows 11

Admin access to your PC

🧾 Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator
Press Start

Type PowerShell

Right-click on it and choose "Run as Administrator"

💻 Step 2: Run the One-Line Install Command
In PowerShell, paste this:

powershell
Copy
Edit
wsl --install
Then press Enter.

This command will:

Enable the WSL feature

Download and install WSL 2 (the newer version)

Install Ubuntu by default (you can change it later)

Reboot your PC if needed

🔁 Step 3: Wait and Restart
Once the installation is complete, your PC may restart.

After reboot, you should see a Ubuntu terminal window open automatically, asking you to create a username and password for Linux.

✅ That means you're all set!

🐧 Step 4: Using WSL
Now you can use WSL just like a Linux terminal.

To open it:

Press Start, type Ubuntu, and open it

Or open Windows Terminal and choose Ubuntu from the tab menu

You can now:

Use Linux commands (ls, cd, touch, etc.)

Install packages via apt:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install nodejs python3 git
🛍️ Step 5: Installing Other Linux Distros (Optional)
If you want something besides Ubuntu (like Debian, Kali, or Arch):

powershell
Copy
Edit
wsl --list --online
To install one:

powershell
Copy
Edit
wsl --install -d <distro-name>
Example:

powershell
Copy
Edit
wsl --install -d debian
📂 Step 6: Accessing Files
You can access Windows files in WSL like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Desktop
And from Windows, you can access Linux files by opening:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
\\wsl$\Ubuntu\
in File Explorer.

🔄 Bonus: Set WSL 2 as Default
If it didn’t already default to WSL 2:

powershell
Copy
Edit
wsl --set-default-version 2
To check your distro’s version:

powershell
Copy
Edit
wsl --list --verbose
To upgrade one:

powershell
Copy
Edit
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
✅ You're Done!
Now you can:

Run Linux scripts

Use Git like in Linux

Run VS Code in Linux mode (code .)

Even use Docker Desktop with WSL 2 integration

💡 Extra Tips
Use Windows Terminal — it’s great for managing PowerShell, Command Prompt, and WSL in one place

Use code . inside WSL to open VS Code with Linux support

Install zsh, fish, or customize your shell for a better terminal experience
